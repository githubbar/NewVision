- use rectangles instead of ellipses (speed up significantly, allowing for more mutations)
- need third BG model, with manually picked time and space region
- if two bodies are traveling too close for too long => overcompensation of the blob => delelte one body
- AmEagle Perspectives:
  = use door trackers info => improve tracking quality
  = use 3D model from Steve => improve tracking quality
