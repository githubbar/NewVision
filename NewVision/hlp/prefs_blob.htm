<P>
Blobs are areas in the image deemed by the tracker to be corresponding to moving objects. Through the process of <STRONG>head candidate selection</STRONG> each blob is assigned one or more <STRONG>head candidates</STRONG> which are points at the top of the blobs representing a possible location of a person's head. Each head candidate has a corresponding <STRONG>foot candidate</STRONG> which is the location on the floor directly below the head.

This dialog controls how blobs are created for your tracking project.

<P>
<H4>1. Blob minimum area </H4>
Blobs that occupy less than this percent of area of the image are discarded. For example: 0.01 = 1%. Increase this value to reduce the number of noise blobs.<BR>
<STRONG>Default setting:</STRONG>0.001
</P> 

<P>
<H4>2. Blob maximum area</H4>
Blobs that occupy more than this percent of area of the image are discarded. For example: 0.2 = 20%. Typically such large blobs can appear if there was a global change in the scene, such as one of the lights shutting off.<BR>
<STRONG>Default setting:</STRONG>0.3
</P> 

<P>
<H4>3. Max bodies in blob</H4>
One blobs can potentially correspond to more than one person. This value sets the upper limit of bodies in a single blob. Increase it for more crowded scenes.<BR>
<STRONG>Default setting:</STRONG>3
</P> 

<P>
<H4>4. Min ray size </H4>
Minimum height of head candidates to be considered as the percentage of the height of the tallest head candidate.<BR>
<STRONG>Default setting:</STRONG>0.6
