- implement MeanShift() for spherical model
- change views to separate child windows (like in LadyBugCap)
- FUTURE: convert to managed code, add NewVision namespace to the project, re-write Serialization in mananged classes
- FUTURE: consider using sparse color histograms and cvCalcEMD2
- UNRESOLVED: fix Body::Body(BlobRay* r, CNewVisionDoc* doc, int id, int frameNumber) to use BlobRay not the top/bot but as the boundaries of ellipsoidal projection

- BUG: app closes the window but stays in memory (stop() conflict?) freezes in SequenceProcessor::Clear();
	FIX: ??? SampleGrabberCB was dealocking the filter's release process
	FIX: calling stop right at the end of CNewVisionDoc::Initialize() does not hang, why?

BUG: in empty (unititialized) project, switching to camera model crashes the app
FEATURE: Create "interest areas" class (directional/non-directional, with possibly a line, poly-line or polygon) with tags assigned to each person moving through the area; in addition to door models (Add new door model COUNTER or tracking mode: count pedestrians passing through (entering/exitting?) a polygonal interest region). Also use areas to lower grouping weight by the checkout and raise it around the entrance

FEATURE: add auto-save for tracking and activity info
FEATURE: Zoom in/out capabilities
FEATURE: Ability to save/restore current project state: frame, tracking state, BG state

FEATURE: modify BG model to merge neighboring codewords that are old enough (think of more optimizations of BG model, run test)

NewVision v1.0:
----------------
- BUG: SequenceProcess::Clear crashes upon closing a running document (in Release)
	FIX: check if theApp->mainWnd exists in TrackerModel::RunTracker() before sending update messages to the window
- BUG: on loading track data in tracking mode does not go to the last frame!
	FIX: changed CNewVisionDoc::OnLoadTrackingData, might require additional thread synchronization
BUG: in CameraModel::DrawVerticalSpheroid() fills a horizontal strip when y is somewhere in the middle (see C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\Visual Studio 2005\Projects\NewVision\Projects\DrawVerticalSperoid bug in frame 104.dat):  
	DESCRIPTION: the problem is due to D1 < -EPSILON; seems D1 is prone to some rounding or overflow error
	FIX 1: increase EPSILON from 0.00001 to 0.01 
	FIX 2: use EPSILON in all comparisons instead of zero
	POTENTIAL FEATURE: use float_control pragma to optimize the slowest part of NewVision (histogram comparison)
- FEATURE: add "always merge with ID" edit box for playback mode to speed up correction

- BUG: floor view won't work; re-work using a separate image
	FIX: overlaying imgFloor on top of video with no transparency
- BUG: pressing escape maximizes and then restores the window (should be OnPause())
	FIX: unknown....just went away LOL
- BUG: in tracking mode CNewVisionDoc:GoToFrame followed by OnPlay() freezes the app
	FIX: a call for LoadLastTrackedFrame() in TrackerModel::Run() was causing it; replaced by disabling navigation
- BUG: loading one project after another breaks, REWORK THE WHOLE THING! I.e AE - Jan 19, 2006 - 1600 - Heatmap.proj after anything crashes,or AE - Jan 12, 2006 - 1600.proj after AE - Jan 12, 2006 from PGR - 1600.proj crashes
	FIX: re-writing DiretX solved this
- BUG: recording video now won't work ; use IVMRWindowlessControl  to get current frame
	FIX: can now display "original input image" on top of DX output 
	(a bit redundant but this way the old recording mechanism works)
- BUG: BackgroundModel::Draw(IplImage* frame) crashes if BG is empty; blobs don't always display, BG subtraction changed under new filters
	FIX: changed checking of imgThermal existance to the check of tracker mode COLOR_THERMAL_PAIR
- BUG: stream reading and pressing Pause sometimes still causes deadlock (see cautolock)
	FIX: hopefully resolved by re-writing directx filters
- FEATURE: button in "Track Editor" to bridge small gaps in tracks (< 5 frames?)

- BUG: Uninstall doesn't work: SOLUTION: copy .msi file as part of the install process
- FEATURE: create fourth type of TrackerModel to work directly with ladybug PGR files 
- FEATURE: in F9 dialog add "Show visibility intervals" button to AfxMessageBox a list of visibility intervals for a selected body
- FEATURE: Created web-installer
- FEATURE: Added vanishing tails to floor view bodies
- BUG: pressing stop twice crashes the app; related: BUG: In NewVisionDoc::Initialize() need to roll-back before returning false, if any of Initialize() methods fails
  FIX: works now (forgot the fix)
- FEATURE: created web-install at http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/oleykin/
- GUI: View tracks list and manage (i.e. delete, set visibility, terminate, cleanup short tracks)
- BUG: in Cuboid.cpp and other obstacles IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC was from Object3D not from obstacle, this prevented correct z-buffer generation
- GUI:  add "terminate track" option to body right click menu
- FEATURE: obstacle and other body intersect punishment: made them adjustable through the dialog
- FEATURE: added tabbed views
- FEATURE: display body ID's in body map of floor view

- FIX: app crashes when changing video file name -> safeRelease(pGraph) in destructor not in DeInitialize()!
- API: Re-write bodymodel.body and body_deletec as CMap<int, Body*>
- FEATURE: Add right mouse click menu to each ID box so that a user can manually correct misclassifications and broken tracks. 
           For example, let's say that a shopper crosses paths with another shopper and NewVision accidentally switches their identities.  
           The user could make the correction and NewVision would record this as a manually switched identity.   
           Similarly, if a shopper walks behind a fixture and the computer creates two separate tracks, the user could manually link these into a single track 
           and NewVision would record this error correction. Also, correcting errors can at the same time serve as validation!!!
- FEATURE: User can manually flag employees and code other important information (e.g., gender: male/female, age category: child/teen/adult/elderly, buyer: yes/no; have an unknown category for all attributes).
	       PATCH: Added "select" option in body tags dialog and don't save anything if it is selected

- BUG: fix stream problems, including the track-bar
   FIX: Use CAutoLock filterLock( &m_FilterCriticalSection ) in everything that works with the Stream (e.g. IMEdiaSeeking methods and TrackerModel::RunTracker)
   FIX: Use CMediaControl::Pause instead of Stop! Use Stop only on exit or new project load.
   FIX: For track bar update not the scroll position but the actual track number to avoid problems with rounding and getting stuck at the same position
   FIX: Get current frame by calling pMediaSample->GetMediaTime() in ProxyTransform::Transform(IMediaSample *pMediaSample)
- GUI: change source name label to edit box in TrackerDialog
- GUI: display bodies outside interest region in different color in BodyModel::Draw();

   FIX: in TrackerModel::RunTracker() call ExportPathInfo() after tracking has been done (Predict() has been called)
- BUG: fix Kalman .... fishy
   FIX: seems to work correctly, but doesnt' help tracking (too much inertia); disabled for now
- BUG: remove outsiders/invisible/dormants works incorrectly in BodyModel (does not remove all bodies)
   FIX: remove from "body" array instead of "accepted" array
- GUI: added blob tracking stage check button to ControlDialog
- GUI: added right->draw histograms 
- FEATURE: created BodyModel::DrawHistograms() to draw body histograms in hot/cold colors
- BUG: if color hist defference penalty is set high => body won't move (color tracking)
   FIX: added the use foreground blob mask in computing and updating color histogram
- GUI: convert some GUI parameters measured in frames to seconds
- GUI/DEBUG: create Debug tab for printing debug echos
- BUG: suspect KalmanPredict and Move() move in the opposite direction in XY plane
   FIX: CLEARED

   FIX: in DrawVerticalSphe	oid() z is higher than the camera: set start and stop to a full circle
- BUG: CSV StopDateTime is the same for all (suspect invisible)
- BUG: move bodies boes not seem to go smoothly and try to match the blob area; see the priors/likelihoods
   FIX: proposed bodymodel prior was computed based on accepted instead of "body (original)" model
- ENHANCE: change Obstacle::Draw to account for edges crossing the image border and reappearing on the other side
  BUG: something more conceptual has to be done to deal with the singularity in spherical mode.
- BUG: while exporting Bodies into body -pahts recently deleted bodies are also added but with the "visible" tag = false
- FEATURE: export body path in form: ID, {##dwell period, dwell start time, dwell duration, fixture ID}
- GUI: in ObstacleDialog add the capability to switch to floor view

- BUG: CameraModel::DrawVerticalSpheroid for perspective camera model is not quite correct
   FIX: calculate angles for two pairs of tangent lines (see code)

NewVision v0.1:
---------------
- write a tool for batch re-formatting of project files (every time I add a new serialized parameter I need this)
   SOLUTION: Create a Windows macro in .ahk and .exe file
- create a sample project!
- create help file!
- the program hands in Release mode....has something to do with CvMat and XVID format
   SOLUTION: do not remove IsRunning() from SequenceProcessor::Run();
- create UpdateRecentlyDeleted and ReplaceNewWithRecentlyDeleted
- create IplImage* distanceMask; with the distance from each point at height mean_h/2 to the camera instead of CameraModel::computeScanlineWeight()
- make m_distanceConfidence interval increase with the increasing distance from the camera
- make CameraModel::computeScanlineWeight() give weights comparable to the body distance to the camera
- CameraModel::computeScanlineWeight() for perspective camera model is not quite correct
- is CameraModel::coordsDistanceFromCamera() right?
- revise scanline weights to reflect the line proportion occupied by a body at average height
- modify acceptance/rejection model to match ECCV paper
   DIFFERENCE: cumulative prior is not a product, but rather an average of individual body priors. otherwise (is body prior is < 1) more bodies are disadvantaged 
   in comparison to fewer bodies
- use optical flow to : detect head rotations (predict position, interpret actions using motion templates)
   RESULTS: NOT reliable, because head region is not detected accurately and flow vectors just give the derivative of the orientation, but there is no base component
- how to update BG dynamically, yet without keeping the false body regions? (from the people standing two long at the same spot?)
	SOLUTION: to remove bodies caused by static background region accumulation look at
	(1) body position change (should be very little)
	(2) body color histogram change (should be very little)
  if this persists for some time (i.e 100 frames) => start update BG under the body and then remove the body
- punish bodies for overlapping each other on the floor plan
- create fBuffer = floor areas occupied by obstacles (punish bodies for moving into the floor obstacle areas)
- split big blobs into two bodies of average height, vertically adjacent = some bodies are just not added around frame 7180 (from a large group)
- use body_zbuffer everywhere (e.g. in Body::ComputeHistogram())
- BUG: in DoorModel::GetDistanceFromClosestDoor() don't use the the [0,0,0] - [0,0,0] line (and if any point in line is close to [0,0,0]
- need a second zbuffer for moving bodies Body::Likelyhood() works incorrectly because the obstacles are accounted for in z-buffer
- make color tracking more reliable=> fixed some histogram related stuff in priors and likelyhoods
- BUG: after "video file corrupt" message if clicking cancel, the application crashes
- Third type of bgmodel imgThermal (mixed?) Pforeground = thermalintensity1 * distancefromcodebook2
- BUG: in perspective projection view in coordsDistanceFromCamera() camera.z == p34 is less than zero!!!
   SOLVED: camera is at [x = 0, y = 0, z = -P34]
- BUG: in Body::UpdateHistogram() z-buffer is not used
- compute BG probability map, i.e. use floating point foreground map and a mask with gaussian kernel for each body  
- BUG: again in DrawVerticalSpheroid() fills a horizontal strip when y is somewhere in the middle (frame = 64925)
   SOLVED: increase EPSILON from 0.00001 to 0.001
- BUG: in DrawVerticalSpheroid() fills a horizontal strip when y is somewhere in the middle
   SOLVED: used (D1 > - EPSILON) and abs(center.x) > EPSILON insted of absolute zeros to check for critical cases
- create a Kalman based model for face orientation based on color, shape and body motion
- BUG: in d2line()
   SOLVED: created d2lineSegment which works differently than a distance to an infinite line
- in Obsctale create a way of moving fixtures along X, Y or Z axes
- create a interest zone door model
- rewinding jumps back a certain amount of time
- opening a new file doesn't clear check boxes in display menu but resets underlying variables
- create SkinModel
- Create a way to save and play back the tracking progress (use BodyPath as a start)
- CHECK : incorporate static fixtures into z-buffer
  // then we can use meanShift properly (the bottom part of the body would not be counted, as being occluded by the fixture)!
- BUG: floor timestamp is shown in the input view
- modify BoyPath::Draw to indicate dwell events with circles
- move bodies with left mouse button
- saving a paused stream, cancels tracking
		SOLUTION: need not call Initialize in NewVisionDoc::OnSave()
- BUG : track bar does not rewind 
- BUG: doors in screen coordinates result in: blobs, further away from the camera are typically considered to be closer to the door !!!  
		SOLUTION: compute distance to the doors in floor coordinates
- add time stamp to the recorded frame
- change likelyhood metric to treat close and far bodies equally 
- look at the small bodies likelyhood gaussian masks; looks OK!
- change DrawVerticalSpheroid() for fill == false (use lines on each side)
- BUG: in DrawVerticalSpheroid in for ( int y = itop.y; y <= ibot.y; y++ )  boundaries are incorrect when it is right below the camera
   SOLUTION: used precise angle boundaries (see calculations of ellipse tangents on paper)
- added uniform variation of DoorModel
- BUG -  CameraModel::coordsImage2Spheric(CvPoint2D32f p)
    // returns lattitude and longtitude [phi, theta] in spherical coordinates from [x,y] - pixel location
	// BUG 1: what if image height != 256 
	// BUG 2: y = h should map to PI!!!! NOT LESS!
- BUG: in computing tangents of cone and spheroid -> center.x is zero sometimes too (division occurs by center.x); 
	SOLUTION: in this case solve through for x first (involves division by center.y)
	          if center.y is zero too then draw a full scanline
- BUG: DrawVerticalSpheroid sometimes draws a full horizontal line where it shouldn't (D1 < 0) case. 
	SOLVED: Due to the discretization at the top and bottom edges of spheroid D1 can be actually less than zero (i.e. the cone does not touch the spheroid)	
- DrawVerticalSpheroid in misbehaves extreeme positions under the cameera
- decided not to use MeanShift, but re-wrote HistogramCompute! re-write MeanShift and HistogramCompute using 3D spheroid projections
- add labels for obstacles
- menu items for play, record, pause and stop. 
- create quicklaunch icon in setup
- re-work tabs to be a tree property sheet
- re-work body model to exclude any camera model dependent calls
- fixed a bug in coordsImage2Real() for SPHERICAL model
- in SPHERICAL model ellipsoids do not project as ellipses into the image, change Body::Rasterize() to account for both models  
- lines are not always perpendicular in the obstacle builder; m_uncropped was unnecessary, instead used 2*h
- depict paths as line segmets with dwelling locations as circles
- create an Alarm recording scheduler class
- create an ObstacleModel to draw paralellograms on the image with the mouse
- use real BB floormap!
- display floor plan w/ heat map
- create separate floor model image in left-lower corner; must have it's own size; display all floor-coordinate outputs there
- indicate sales reps by color histograms
- generate heat maps on the right
- add bg subtraction age to the dialog!
- work on comparing paths using weighted 2D correlation (for shopping groups)
- add a possible mutation: split body in two if if does not cover the blob!  
- work on floor plan and traveling path:
- smooth the trajectories
- SetHeight() creates negative body width => set width to height*WIDTH_RATIO
- blobs further away are less likely to get a body assigned (is due to poor calibration)
  solution: resize intitial candidates to mean size if too big/small
- !!! This is incorporated in punnishments for excessive blobs !!!
  make sure that each blob is at least parially covered by one body
  (penalize for uncoveredblobpixels == blobpixels )
- decrease id if model was rejected
- contain memory usage growth
- get an array of points in efficient way (major bottleneck!!) in Body::ComputeHistogram
- use ROI where possible in the images
- draw flat XY movements map in the output image
- create door model and compute add/remove priors based on the door proximity
- modify BG subtraction to exclude existing bodies
